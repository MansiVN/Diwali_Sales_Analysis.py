# DIWALI SALES ANALYSIS - EDA

This project analyzes Diwali sales data retrieved from a CSV file. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook with Python. The dataset contains information about sales during the Diwali period, and the analysis aims to explore patterns, trends, and insights from this data.

The dataset used for this analysis is stored in a CSV file named diwali_sales_data.csv.




## Tools Used

Python: Programming language used for data analysis     
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for running Python code, data visualization, and analysis.    
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis      
NumPy: Library for numerical operations and array manipulation      
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for data visualization
## Steps

1. Data Loading: This involves importing the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.   
2. Data Cleaning: This step includes identifying and addressing missing values, resolving inconsistencies, and preparing the data for in-depth analysis. 
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In this phase, the dataset is thoroughly examined to grasp its structure, obtain summary statistics, and derive initial insights.    
4. Data Visualization: Utilizing visual aids like line plots, bar charts, or pie charts to visually represent sales trends, popular products, or any pertinent patterns present in the data.     
5. Conclusions: Conclude by summarising the analysis results and presenting the key insights gleaned from the data examination.
